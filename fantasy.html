        <h1>5. Princess Mononoke</h1>
        <img src="images/princess-mononoke.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Of course one of the masterpiece films from Studio Ghibli would show up on this list. Written and directed by filmmaking legend Hayao Miyazaki delves into many elements of Japanese legend and fantasy as it tells the story of Ashitaka, a prince seeking to free himself from a demon’s curse. While trying to save himself, the prince becomes embroiled in a war to save the forest and the mythical creatures who live within it. Along with a wolf god and human companion Princess Mononoke, Ashitaka tries to find a way to bring peace. Of all of Miyazaki’s films this is probably the most action packed, but the animation legend, never loses focus of the deep and awe-inspiring story.</p><br><br>

        <h1>4. The Crow</h1>
        <img src="images/the-crow.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Based on the indie comic by James O’Barr, the Crow has become a cult classic that is still loved by filmgoers. The powerful themes of love and revenge mixed with stunning visuals and action still has the ability to hook audiences. On the night before his wedding, musician Eric Draven is murdered along with his fiancée by a local gang. His soul is unable to rest in peace, so one year after his death the crow who took his soul to the underworld returned Draven to life with a host of supernatural abilities. His purpose is now to stalk the rainy urban wasteland of the city to have his revenge on those wronged him. The Crow will forever be remembered for the tragic death of Brandon Lee due to an accident on the set. Having spent much of his career typecast as an action star, this was expected to be his breakout role where Lee would prove just how talented he was.</p><br><br>

        <p>Many have argued that this is the greatest animated film of all time, and it is undoubtedly a cornerstone of the Disney Renaissance.

        <h1>1. Edward Scissorhands</h1>
        <img src="images/edward.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This film more than any others in his filmography epitomizes Tim Burton as a director. An isolated inventor creates for himself a son, but he tragically dies before giving his creation hands, dooming Edward to a life of having blades for hands. Edward goes about his life in a perfectly Burton-esque wonderland until a family brings him into suburbia and tries to integrate him into regular society. Inevitably a deep relationship is forged with the family’s daughter which only leads to heartbreak as it becomes increasingly clear that there is no place for an unique and artistic creature like Edward in a cookie-cutter society. Edward Scissorhands is the perfect showcase Tim Burton’s sensibilities as a filmmaker, and his story perfectly presented with heartfelt performances from Johnny Depp and Wynona Ryder.  This fantasy classic also features the final screen appearance from film icon, Vincent Price.</p><br><br>
