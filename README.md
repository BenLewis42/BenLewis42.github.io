# BenLewis42.github.io

This repository has been reset to a minimal blank GitHub Pages template (static `index.html`).

If you want the repository cleaned (delete existing `posts/`, `images/`, `Gifs/`, and the Jekyll files), run the included PowerShell script `cleanup.ps1` from the repository root:

```powershell
.\cleanup.ps1
```

After running the script, review the changes and commit them. If you prefer I run the cleanup here for you, tell me and I will proceed.
